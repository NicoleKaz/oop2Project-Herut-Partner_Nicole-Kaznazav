Game instructions:
The goal of the game: 
to reach the end of the lavel as quickly as possible with as many coins as possible.

The player moves by pressing space to jump or left and right arrows to move forward or backward. 

If the player crashes into an obstacle such as a thorn, spiked wheel, running enemy, shooting enemy or his bullet the stage restarts.

The player can collect coins during the game that will give him special powers:
1. Flight - cancels after crossing gate
2. Extra speed - for a certain time.
3. Shield - for a certain time.

During the game there are gates that the player can enter through and they change the player states:
1. Gravity Gate - Changes the gravity in the game so that the player is pulled up or down.
2. Gate to cancel the flight - when the player passes, he returns to normal state

In addition, there are bouncers in the game-
The bouncers give him a strong jump boost and help the player go over obstacles.
